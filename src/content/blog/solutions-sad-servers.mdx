## Linux Commands Cheatsheet

``` yaml
grep: Search for patterns in files, printing matching lines.
wc: Counts lines, words, and characters in one or more files. (-l for counting lines)
df: Display filesystem disk space usage, showing available and used space on mounted filesystems.
du: Display disk space usage of files and directories, summarizing their sizes.
awk: A powerful text-processing tool for extracting and manipulating data from files.
less: View file contents page by page, allowing navigation and search within large files.
xargs: Build and execute command lines from standard input, often used with other commands for complex operations.
knock: used to send a sequence of connection attempts (knocks) to specified ports on a remote server to trigger actions such as opening a port.
```

## ‚ùå Saint John

A developer created a testing program that is continuously writing to a log file /var/log/bad.log and filling up disk. You can check for example with tail -f /var/log/bad.log. This program is no longer needed. Find it and terminate it.

So let‚Äôs see what is accessing this file with lsof:

```sh
$ lsof /var/log/bad.log
COMMAND PID USER FD TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
badlog.py 621 ubuntu 3w REG 259,1 10629 67701 /var/log/bad.log
```

Second column lists the ID of the process what writes to the log.

We‚Äôll kill this process using kill:
```sh
kill 621
```

We can accomplish the same task in one command by grepping (filtering) the output of the lsof command and searching for "badlog.py". Then, we extract the second result and use it as a parameter with xargs to kill that specific PID.
```sh
lsof /var/log/bad.log | grep -w 'badlog.py' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill
```

## üßÆ Saskatoon - Counting IPs

In this scenario we have to find what's the IP address that has the most requests in the file /home/admin/access.log.

By reading the file we can see all messages have the following format:

```bash
less /home/admin/access.log
83.149.9.216 - - [17/May/2015:10:05:50 +0000] "GET /presentations/logstash-monitorama-2013/images/kibana-dashboard.png HTTP/1.1" 200 321631 "http://semicomplete.com/presentations/logstash-monitorama-2013/" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/32.0.1700.77 Safari/537.36"
```

Looks like `awk` commmand is perfect for this scenario as it allows you to perform operations on text files, usually line by line. 
In this way we can get first field of each line in the file.

```bash
awk '{print $1}' /home/admin/access.log
awk '{print $1}' /home/admin/access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 1 | awk '{print $2}' > /home/admin/highestip.txt
```

## üî° Santiago - Find the secret combination

In this scenario, we are going to count the number of times "Alice" appears in some text files.

- The first command is a simple word count (wc) of the lines that contain "Alice".
- The second command filters for "Alice" and includes the next line with the `-A 1` flag. It then filters again to extract numbers.

Afterward, it's simply a matter of writing the two results to the file in the specified format.


```bash
cat /home/admin/*.txt | grep Alice | wc -l  > /home/admin/solution
cat /home/admin/1342-0.txt | grep Alice -A 1 | grep -o '[0-9]\+' >> /home/admin/solution
```


## üó°Ô∏è The Command Line Murders

This one was really fun, but I think it could easily take more than 20 minutes if you are not using the hints.

First, we are going to read the crimescene file and filter by the important information, the clues:

```bash
grep "CLUE" /home/admin/clmystery/mystery/crimescene
- Tall man 6'
- Cards for Rotary_Club, Delta SkyMiles, the local library, and the Museum of Bash History.
- A woman left right before they heard the shots. The name on her latte was Annabel, she had blond spiky hair and a New Zealand accent.
```

Let's investigate the witness. Filtering for women named Annabel, we get two results:

```bash
cat /home/admin/clmystery/mystery/people | grep Annabel
Annabel Sun     F       26      Hart Place, line 40
Annabel Church  F       38      Buckingham Place, line 179
```

Following the addresses, we can see what information the interviews have. As we know that Annabel has a New Zealand accent, we can discard the first result.

```bash
head -n 40 /home/admin/clmystery/mystery/streets/Hart_Place | tail -n 1
SEE INTERVIEW #47246024

cat /home/admin/clmystery/mystery/interviews/interview-47246024 
Ms. Sun has brown hair and is not from New Zealand.  Not the witness from the cafe.


head -n 179 /home/admin/clmystery/mystery/streets/Buckingham_Place | tail -n 1
SEE INTERVIEW #699607

cat /home/admin/clmystery/mystery/interviews/interview-699607 
Interviewed Ms. Church at 2:04 pm.  Witness stated that she did not see anyone she could identify as the shooter, that she ran away as soon as the shots were fired.
However, she reports seeing the car that fled the scene.  Describes it as a blue Honda, with a license plate that starts with "L337" and ends with "9"
```


So now we know that the thief drives a blue Honda and part of its plate number. Also, the owner must be a man with a height greater than 6'. After filtering car information, we end up with two results.

```bash
grep "L337..9" /home/admin/clmystery/mystery/vehicles -A5 | grep "Honda" -A4 -B1 | grep "Blue" -A3 -B2

License Plate L337DV9
Make: Honda
Color: Blue
Owner: Joe Germuska
Height: 6'2"
Weight: 164 lbs
--
License Plate L3375A9
Make: Honda
Color: Blue
Owner: Jeremy Bowers
Height: 6'1"
Weight: 204 lbs
```

Let's quickly check if there have been any interviews done with these guys:

```bash
grep -E "Joe Germuska|Jeremy Bowers" /home/admin/clmystery/mystery/people
Joe Germuska    M       65      Plainfield Street, line 275
Jeremy Bowers   M       34      Dunstable Road, line 284


head -n 275 /home/admin/clmystery/mystery/streets/Plainfield_Street | tail -n 1
SEE INTERVIEW #29741223

cat /home/admin/clmystery/mystery/interviews/interview-29741223 
Not available to interview


head -n 284 /home/admin/clmystery/mystery/streets/Dunstable_Road | tail -n 1
SEE INTERVIEW #9620713

cat /home/admin/clmystery/mystery/interviews/interview-9620713 
Home appears to be empty, no answer at the door.
After questioning neighbors, appears that the occupant may have left for a trip recently.
Considered a suspect until proven otherwise, but would have to eliminate other suspects to confirm.
```

Nothing really useful, but if you remember from the clues, we can check their memberships and see which one matches all the ones mentioned in the clue:

```bash
grep "Jeremy Bowers" /home/admin/clmystery/mystery/memberships/Museum_of_Bash_History  /home/admin/clmystery/mystery/memberships/Rotary_Club /home/admin/clmystery/mystery/memberships/Delta_SkyMiles  /home/admin/clmystery/mystery/memberships/Terminal_City_Library 
/home/admin/clmystery/mystery/memberships/Museum_of_Bash_History:Jeremy Bowers
/home/admin/clmystery/mystery/memberships/Delta_SkyMiles:Jeremy Bowers
/home/admin/clmystery/mystery/memberships/Terminal_City_Library:Jeremy Bowers

grep "Joe Germuska" /home/admin/clmystery/mystery/memberships/Museum_of_Bash_History  /home/admin/clmystery/mystery/memberships/Rotary_Club /home/admin/clmystery/mystery/memberships/Delta_SkyMiles  /home/admin/clmystery/mystery/memberships/Terminal_City_Library 
/home/admin/clmystery/mystery/memberships/Museum_of_Bash_History:Joe Germuska
/home/admin/clmystery/mystery/memberships/Rotary_Club:Joe Germuska
/home/admin/clmystery/mystery/memberships/Delta_SkyMiles:Joe Germuska
/home/admin/clmystery/mystery/memberships/Terminal_City_Library:Joe Germuska
```

We see that only Joe matches all four memberships, so we can conclude this is our guy.

```bash
echo "Joe Germuska" > ~/mysolution
```


## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Taipei - Come a-knocking

In this scenario we are going to learn about Port Knocking.

Port knocking is a security technique used to control access to a network service by requiring clients to perform a specific sequence of connection attempts, or "knocks," on closed ports. Here's how it works:

- **Initial State:** All ports on the server are closed.
- **Knock Sequence:** The client sends a sequence of connection attempts to predefined ports.
- **Sequence Recognition:** The server monitors and verifies the sequence. If correct, it temporarily opens the desired port.
- **Access Granted:** The client can access the service, after which the port may be closed again.

We are given a web server listening on port 80. In this scenario is just a matter of knocking this port, but realisticly it would be a secounce of port what enables us to communicate.

```bash
# Example
knock <server-ip> 9012 5678 1234

# Solution
knock localhost 80
curl localhost
```

Now if we curl localhost we get a message instead of a connection refused.
